# Phone Number Gist Regex Tutorial

Regular expressions (regex) are powerful tools for matching and validating text patterns. In this tutorial, we will explore the construction of a regex pattern for matching phone numbers. Phone numbers come in various formats, so we'll create a versatile regex pattern that can handle many common cases.

## Summary

In this tutorial, we'll create a regular expression pattern to match phone numbers. The pattern is designed to handle various common phone number formats, such as (XXX) XXX-XXXX, XXX-XXX-XXXX, and XXX.XXX.XXXX. We'll break down the regex into components, explaining anchors, quantifiers, the OR operator, character classes, flags, grouping, capturing, bracket expressions, greedy and lazy matching, boundaries, back-references, and look-ahead/look-behind techniques. By the end of this tutorial, you'll have a comprehensive understanding of building regex patterns for phone numbers.

## Regex Components

### Anchors
Anchors (^ and $) are used to specify the start and end of the text we want to match. In our phone number regex, ^ ensures that the pattern starts from the beginning of the string, and $ ensures it ends at the end of the string.

### Quantifiers
Quantifiers specify how many times a character or group should be repeated. In our regex, we use \d{3} to match three digits for the area code and \d{4} for the last four digits.

### OR Operator
The OR operator (denoted by |) allows us to specify alternatives. In our regex, we use [-.\s] to match any of the common phone number separators (hyphen, period, or space).

### Character Classes
Character classes are enclosed in square brackets ([]) and allow you to match a single character from a set of characters. In our regex, we use [()] to match an optional set of parentheses around the area code.

### Flags
Flags like i can be added to regex patterns to make the pattern case-insensitive. In our tutorial, we don't use flags, but you can include them as needed.

### Grouping and Capturing
Grouping with parentheses allows us to capture parts of the matched text. In our regex, we use parentheses to group the area code and the last four digits.

### Bracket Expressions
Bracket expressions like [a-z] match any single character within a range. We don't use bracket expressions in our phone number regex.

### Greedy and Lazy Match
In regex, quantifiers are greedy by default, meaning they match as much as possible. You can make them lazy by adding a ? after the quantifier.

### Boundaries
Boundaries like \b are used to match at word boundaries. We don't use boundaries in our phone number regex.

### Back-references
Back-references allow you to match a previously captured group. We don't use back-references in our phone number regex.

### Look-ahead and Look-behind
Look-ahead and look-behind are advanced techniques that let you match text based on what comes before or after it. We don't use them in our tutorial.
